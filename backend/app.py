##Instruction: Taking into account the Definitions of various fields and their respective values a model is trained to predict weather a person will expericen delinquency or not in the next 2 years. Below both the values that was input to the model and the result produced by the model are provided. As a bank employee response to the candidate, It is expected to provide a detailed reason in layman language as to why a Credit request was rejected or processed given the profile of the candidate. Also while providing reason do not mention the use of AI model being used for decision making.

DebtRatio=Monthly debt payments, alimony,living costs divided by monthy gross income DataType=percentage
MonthlyIncome=Monthly income in INR DataType=real
NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans=Number of Open loans (installment like car loan or mortgage) and Lines of credit (e.g. credit cards) DataType=integer
